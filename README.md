# Build a web app in JavaScript :
In this new project, I'm going to finish up the last project called 0x0B. I'll use Bootstrap to make the design look good, and I'll add some moving parts using JavaScript, especially jQuery.

I'll take the final files we made in 0x0B, where we already used Bootstrap for the design, and I'll update them to make things even better.

I'm going to use all the things I learned about HTML, CSS, making websites accessible, responsive design, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. The cool part is, I don't have a lot of rules to follow. I'm free to do it how I want. The main goal is to end up with web pages that work well and look just like the design file.

So, my job is to make sure the web pages I create match what the designer had in mind.
